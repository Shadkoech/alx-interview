# Pascal's Triangle

This Python project focuses on implementing Pascal's Triangle using Python programming concepts. Pascal's Triangle is a fascinating mathematical structure that generates a triangular array of binomial coefficients.


## Basic overview of Pascal's triangle

- The elements in the Pascals triangle can find out by finding the sum of the two adjoint elements in the preceding row.
- The sum of values in the nth row is 2^n
- Pascal's triangle is used to determine the coefficients of binomial expansions.

## Porject description

This Pascal's triangle project aims to create a function `pascal_triangle(n)` that actually generates Pascal's triangle of `n` rows and returns a lits of integers that actually represent the generated triangle.


## Task

###  Task 0:

File:

	- 0-pascal_triangle.py

Create a function `pascal_triangle(n)` that returns a list of lists of integers representing the Pascalâ€™s triangle of `n`:
- Returns an empty list if `n <= 0`
- Assumes `n` will always be an integer


## Key concepts
- Lists and List Comprehensions
- Functions
- Loops
- Conditional Statements
- Recursion (Optional)
- Arithmetic Operations
- Indexing and Slicing
-  Error and Exception Handling (Optional)
- Efficiency and Optimization


## How to run

clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/alx-interview`
Navigate to the project directory `cd alx-interview/0x00-pascal_triangle`
Run the main script `./0-main.py`
