# Star Wars API

## Introduction
This project aims to provide you with an opportunity to interact with the Star Wars API using JavaScript. By completing the tasks outlined in this project, one gains hands-on experience in making HTTP requests, working with APIs, and managing asynchronous code in JavaScript.

## Description
This project aims to develop a script that interacts with the Star Wars API to retrieve and display information about characters from a specified Star Wars movie. The script will take the movie ID as a command-line argument and print the names of all characters appearing in that movie.

## Concepts applied
- Making HTTP requests in JavaScript.
- Working with RESTful APIs and parsing JSON data.
- Asynchronous programming using callbacks, promises, and async/await syntax.
- Command-line arguments in Node.js.
- Array manipulation and iteration in JavaScript.

## Task
File:
    - 0-starwars_characters.js

Write a script that prints all characters of a Star Wars movie:
- The first positional argument passed is the Movie ID - example: 3 = “Return of the Jedi”
- Display one character name per line in the same order as the “characters” list in the /films/ endpoint
- You must use the Star wars API
- You must use the request module
