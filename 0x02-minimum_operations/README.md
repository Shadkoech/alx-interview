# 0x02. Minimum Operations

## Overview
The "Minimum Operations" project addresses a common problem encountered in text editing. It involves finding the minimum number of operations required to achieve a specific number of characters using only "Copy All" and "Paste" operations in a text editor. This problem is particularly relevant in scenarios where repetitive text generation is required such as: Duplicating content, generating sequences or automating document formatting. 

Starting from a single character in a given text file, One can perform two operations that include;
1. `Copy All`: Operation allows you to copy all the existing characters in a file
2. `Paste`: The operation pastes the characters currently copied into the text file

With these operations, the objective is to reach a desired number of characters, denoted by 'n', using the fewest number of operations possible. The project aims to devise an algorithmic solution, implemented in Python, to determine the minimum number of operations required to achieve the specified number of characters.


## Significance of Minimum Operations
The concept of minimum operations is key in the following ways:
- Understanding how to efficiently duplicate content using basic operations can streamline text editing workflows.
- When automating tasks such as script generation or document processing, minimizing the number of operations can lead to faster execution and improved efficiency.
- Solving this problem requires a blend of algorithmic thinking, mathematical reasoning, and programming skills, making it an excellent exercise for enhancing problem-solving abilities.


## Task

File:

    - 0-minoperations.py, 0-main.py

In a text file, there is a single character H. Your text editor can execute only two operations in this file: Copy All and Paste. Given a number n, write a method that calculates the fewest number of operations needed to result in exactly n H characters in the file.
- Prototype: `def minOperations(n)`
- Returns an integer
- If `n` is impossible to achieve, return 0
Example:
n = 9
H => Copy All => Paste => HH => Paste =>HHH => Copy All => Paste => HHHHHH => Paste => HHHHHHHHH
Number of operations: 6
